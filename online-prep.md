#Preparing your classes for online

Hello! Thanks for being part of IDM online. Preparing your class is a little more involved than a traditional syllabus, but it's well worth it in the end.

You're going to be making a *multimedia* textbook that will include text, images, code and/or video.

Storyboards are important!
