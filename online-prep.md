# Preparing your classes for online

Hello! Thanks for being part of IDM online. Preparing your class is a little more involved than a traditional syllabus, but it's well worth it in the end.

You're going to be making a *multimedia* textbook that will include text, images, code and/or video.

What's the process? 
ID and ET meet with you to think through the content of your course. 

there is synchromnous and asynchronous stuff. You are preparing the asynch content first, the synchronous is what happens when you interface with the students one-to-one.

Storyboards are important!
